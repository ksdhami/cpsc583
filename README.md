# 24 Hours of Le Mans Data Visualisation 
Drivers from all over come to Le Mans, France to take part in the oldest sports car endurance race in the world, around the Circuit de la Sarthe, the 24 hours of Le Mans. Beginning in 1923, a 2978cc 4 cylinder engine powered a Chenard & Walcker Sport to win the first ever 24 hours of Le Mans. The car traveled a total distance of 2209.536 km with an average speed of 92.064 km/h.
